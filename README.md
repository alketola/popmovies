The PopMovies is the Popular Movies project app for Associate Android Developer Fast Track course by Udacity.

The app fetches movie detail data and poster images from themoviedb.com, using their public API.

To make this work in this early version, one must obtain a valid API key from themoviedb.com, 
and edit MainActivity.java, putting the version 3 API as the initializer string of mApiKey. 

    private String mApiKey = "PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

I agree that this is not handy, there should be a SettingsActivity to set this along other settings.

This one was put together by Mr. Antti L S Ketola, following the course curriculum.
