The PopMovies shows Popular Movies from The Movie Database. 
Originally, it was the project app for Associate Android Developer Fast Track course by Udacity.

The app fetches movie detail data and poster images from themoviedb.com, using their public API.

To make this work in this basic version, one must obtain a valid API key from themoviedb.com, 
and introduce the API key to Settings. 

This one was put together by Mr. Antti L S Ketola, following the course curriculum.
